# [Culture](README.md) - Team Health

Below are 5 key aspects that can help teams mitigate some of the common challenges and drive the successful creation of a DevOps friendly culture

1. *Create a no blame environment*: Blame – even directed inwards – is a negative thing and doesn’t help to gain insight into the context of the situation or how to reduce the risk in the future
1. *Encourage change*: We need to work across the wider organization to ensure they accept the fact that change is a good thing and not something to be feared
1. *Good leadership*: Leaders can shape a companies culture through their behaviors therefore it is essential that we recognize and reward the right behaviors
1. *Embrace failure*: Failure is the opportunity to learn. If you don’t learn from your failure, then you’re just wasting time. So don’t punish failure, but punish not learning from failure
1. *Support trust, honesty, openness and transparency*: The most important cultural ingredients a team must establish and cultivate are trust, being honest, transparent and open


## Creating a no blame environment

Blame – even directed inwards – is a negative thing and doesn’t help to gain insight into the context of the situation or how to reduce the risk in the future

### Approach

Encouraging collaboration between teams

Removing the fear of repercussions

Teams should own the failures instead of individuals

Always considering the bigger picture


## Encourage Change

In the same vein as fostering innovation and accountability at grass roots, we need to work across the wider organization to ensure they accept the fact that change is a good thing and not something to be feared

### Approach

Select

Pick a small change and ensure that it is well publicized around the business

Engage

Engage the wider business, focusing on the risk averse, and ensure they are aware; also invite them to observe and contribute (stand-ups, planning meetings, etc)

Ensure Awareness

Ensure that the engineers working on the change are also aware that there is a heightened sense of observation for the change

Share Progress

As the change is progressing, get the engineering teams involved to post regular blog entries detailing what they are doing, including stats and figures (code coverage, test pass rate, and so on)

Measure and Publish

As the release goes through the various environments to production, capture as many stats and measurements as possible and publish them.

Share Lessons Learned

When all is done, pull all the above into a blog post and a post-release report, then present them


## Good Leadership

Good leaders help build great teams, great technology, and great organizations indirectly, by enabling teams to re-architect their systems and implement continuous delivery and lean management practices

Transformational leadership enables the necessary practices that correlate with high performance, and it also supports effective communication and collaboration between team members in pursuit of organizational goals. Such leadership provides the foundation for a culture in which continuous experimentation and learning is part of everybody’s daily work


## Embrace Failure

Failure is the opportunity to learn. If you don’t learn from your failure, then you’re just wasting time. So don’t punish failure, but punish not learning from failure

### Approach

Fail Early

This will allow us to get real and fast feedback about what works and what does not

Fail Fast

We want to fail quickly so that we can begin the learning process as fast as possible

Fail Often

This will remove the need to waste time by working on incorrect avenues and steer the project in the right direction

Fail Better

With early and frequent failures all that is needed is to maximise the learning opportunities


## Support Trust Honesty and Transparency

If DevOps is about culture and collaboration, then the most important cultural ingredients a team must establish and cultivate are trust, honesty, openness and transparency.

What does this mean?

Everyone involved in product delivery should openly comment and discuss ideas, issues, concerns, and problems

Everyone involved in product delivery should have no fear of ridicule or retribution.

Why do we need it?

To ensure that the implementation of CD and DevOps is successful

To break down silos and barriers

To implement the much-needed changes throughout your organization

To have a forum to share thoughts, suggestions, observations, worries, and news

To surface details and facts that otherwise would have been missed or stayed hidden

### Approach

Encouraging face-to-face human interaction

Using online collaboration tools i.e. Confluence

Setting up real-time forums

Using group chat systems i.e. Slack

Arranging Show and Tell sessions for every milestone achieved

Running retrospectives to illuminate what is broken and what is working flawlessly

Providing teams with a holistic view of how the business is changing

Providing a view of the adoption of quality standards


## Healthy Leadership Teams

Healthy leadership teams have the following characteristics:

Trust one another

When team members are genuinely transparent and honest with one another, they build vulnerability-based trust.

Engage in Conflict Around Ideas

When there is trust, team members engage in unfiltered, constructive debate of ideas.

Commit to decisions

When team members offer opinions and debate ideas, they are more likely to commit to decisions.

Hold one another Accountable

When everyone is committed to a clear plan of action, they will be more likely to hold one another accountable.

Focus on achieving collective Results

The goal of building greater trust, conflict, commitment and accountability is one thing: the achievement of results.


Approach to achieving healthy leadership teams:

Create Clarity

Purpose: Achieve clarity for the leadership team’s behaviours, priorities and responsibilities.

Establish Team Number One

Purpose: To build shared goals across the team. Ensure all team members place a higher priority on the team they are a member of than the team they lead in their Domains.

Focus

Purpose: To commit and agree to a singular most important goal in the short to mid term, for the Domain leadership team.

Build Trust

Purpose: To enable vulnerability in the team and help build honest conversations where egos don’t get in the way and mutual respect and compassion develops.

One Improvement

Purpose: To move items from a person’s blind spot into a focus area for improvement.

Gain Agreement

Purpose: To decide and commit to specific agreements and understandings before leaving the room
