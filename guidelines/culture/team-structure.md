## Cross Functional Teams

A team of individuals who iteratively define, build, test, and deliver value to their customers E2E. These teams have the authority and accountability to manage their work, which increases productivity and accelerates time-to-market.  Cross-functional teams have all of the skills needed to get the work done, with plenty of skills overlapping to reduce the dependency on the skills and expertise of any one team member.  Work, and consequently the 'success' of the team, is the collective responsibility of all of the team members.



What are the benefits of a truly cross-functional team?

Getting to done – Teams that are not cross-functional at all, for example, a team purely made up of testers, will find it virtually impossible to get anything of any complexity ‘done’ (potentially shippable) in a sprint.

Self-organising – Due to the variety of skills in a cross-functional team they are often more likely to naturally be self-organised

Innovative – Many cross-functional teams will also be notably innovative as their wide variety of skills and specialisms allow them to be flexible, creative and to adapt swiftly to change.

Increased flow – Not having to depend on others outside of the team minimises dependencies and maintains a flow of valuable work through the team. Removing bottlenecks such as reliance on others for sign off/deployment/testing etc. further increases the predictability of the team’s delivery.

Autonomous - Each autonomous team should have E2E ownership of a feature and the ability to independently produce release candidates to each market in production

## Broken Comb Teams

A cross-functional multi-skilled team is more equipped to deliver customer value, such as an agile/scrum team. A T-shaped or 'broken comb' individual will usually be able to contribute more to the workings of an agile team. A broken comb individual is an extension of a T-shaped person where the broken comb shape represents the 'skill depth' of the individual. These individuals possess various specialist skills instead of a single specialty and display knowledge, skill and varying degrees of competence in diverse knowledge domains, usually acquired through years of experience and practice. As a result, a team composed of broken comb individuals benefits from overlapping skill sets that reduce bottlenecks and elevate team performance.

## Team Topologies

Team Topologies is a framework for building and running systems successfully. It prescribes the ways in which teams should interact and interrelate with each other, emphasising autonomy and a “Team First” approach, treating teams as the fundamental means of delivery

It also describes how Conway’s law can be put into practise and stresses the importance of efficiently managing the teams cognitive load. 

## Team Types

Based on Team Topologies each team has a clear purpose it needs to cover to be successful 

Stream-aligned team:

Identify requirements aligned to business streams

In charge of product releases specific to their business stream

Put releases in production

Support reliability of the product in production

Platform team:

Provide platform as a service to the stream aligned teams in order to ease the product releases in production

Enable stream aligned teams to perform continuous delivery practices without requiring big amounts of cognitive load

Sub-system team:

Specialised complex sub-system team belonging to a platform usually aligned to vendor systems, legacy systems, etc

Provide consumption of complex systems as a service

Enabling team:

Facilitates adoption of continuous delivery practices within all other teams

Facilitates and enables the consumption and adoption of platform and sub-system components for the stream aligned teams 

Interaction modes

There are 3 types of interaction which teams will face throughout their longevity:

Collaboration:

Two teams work closely together for a defined period to discover new patterns, approaches and limitations. Responsibility is shared and boundaries blurred, but problems re solved rapidly and the organization learns quickly

X-as-a -service:

One team consumes something (such as a service on an API) provided “as a service” from another team. Responsibilities are clearly delineated and – if boundary is effective – the consuming team can deliver rapidly. The team providing the service seeks to make their service as easy to consume as possible

Facilitating:

One team helps another team to learn or adopt new approaches for a defined period of time. The team providing the facilitation aims to make the other team self-sufficient as soon as possible, while the team receiving the facilitation has an open-minded attitude to learning
