# Development Practices


## [Branching Strategy](branching-strategy.md)
Trunk-based development is a required practice for continuous integration. If build and test processes are automated but developers work on isolated, lengthy feature branches that are infrequently integrated into a shared branch, continuous integration is not living up to its potential. Trunk-based development eases the friction of code integration. When developers finish new work, they must merge the new code into the main branch. Yet they should not merge changes to the truck until they have verified that they can build successfully.


## [Code Quality](code-quality.md)
High-quality code is more reliable, easier to maintain, and less prone to bugs and defects. This reduces the time and effort required for debugging and troubleshooting, enabling developers to work more efficiently. Having the right code structure, standards and principles also help accelerate the code review process which positively impacts team efficiency and morale.


## [Defect Management](defect-management.md)
Effective defect management is a pivotal accelerator of workflow efficiency within software development. By promptly identifying, documenting, and addressing defects, teams can reduce the time spent on troubleshooting and debugging, leading to faster issue resolution. Ultimately, efficient defect management ensures that resources are directed toward value-adding tasks rather than firefighting, resulting in the timely delivery of high-quality software to end-users.


## [Documentation](documentation.md)
The presence of the right documentation in software delivery is paramount. It acts as a bridge of knowledge transfer, enabling teams to build, understand, maintain, and troubleshoot software effectively. Proper documentation enhances software maintainability, facilitates debugging, fosters collaboration, and ensures scalability.


## [Technical Debt Management](technical-debt-management.md)
By addressing and reducing technical debt, teams can ensure that their codebase remains maintainable and adaptable. This results in faster development cycles, as developers spend less time navigating complex and error-prone code. Technical debt management also reduces the risk of unexpected issues and costly rework, allowing teams to focus on delivering new features and improvements more rapidly.



## [Testability](testability.md)
Testability is integral to successful software delivery as it enables thorough testing and quality assurance. It ensures early detection of defects, faster development cycles, and efficient test automation, which are critical for timely releases in competitive markets. Collaboration between developers and testers is enhanced, and it mitigates the risk of critical issues reaching production, leading to better user experiences and overall software quality. Furthermore, testability encourages documentation, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and process optimisation.


## [Traceability In Version Control](traceability-in-version-control.md)
Traceability within version control systems is a powerful accelerator of workflow efficiency. It provides a clear and organised record of changes, enabling teams to track and understand the evolution of a project's codebase. This traceability is invaluable for debugging, auditing, and ensuring compliance. It allows teams to quickly pinpoint the source of issues, reducing troubleshooting time and accelerating the resolution of problems. Traceability in version control not only enhances code quality but also expedites the development process by streamlining issue identification and resolution.


## [Work In Progress](work-in-progress.md)
By limiting the amount of work that is in progress at any given time, teams can focus on completing tasks efficiently, reducing context switching and multitasking. This approach promotes better prioritisation, faster task completion, and improved overall productivity. It also minimises the risk of bottlenecks and delays caused by overwhelming workloads, ensuring that work moves swiftly from initiation to completion.
