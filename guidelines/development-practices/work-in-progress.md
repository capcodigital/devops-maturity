# [Development Practices](README.md) - Work In Progress


Keeping track of tasks is key to ensure that the right functionality is delivered at the right time. Using a tool such as Jira allows a view of the tasks to do, done and those in progress. The team should have the mindset that any work they are doing directly relates to a "task on the board" and that this task is shown as work in progress (WIP).

Putting limits on the amount of WIP is an effective way to ensure that the team gets work items fully finished before new ones are started.

However, finding the right limit of WIP can be tricky:
* Set too high and there is the risk that too many items are being worked on, ultimately leading to them not receiving the proper focus and taking longer to complete
* Set too low and you risk people being idle (more on this later)

There are no hard and fast rules about WIP limits, it depends on the size and structure of the team. A good place to start is to:

* Set the max WIP in any part of the process to the number of people able to work on that task
* Agree on the criteria for a ticket to pass on to the next part of the process
* Agree on the **Definition of Done** so that the ticket leaves the process to the appropriate standard

There will be times when some or part of the team is without work due to the WIP limits e.g. blocked by another ticket. This is not a time to relax the limit as this will ultimately put increased pressure on those parts of the process which are less optimal. This "spare time" should be put to use by working on improving the overall process.
