# Infrastructure


## [Architecture](architecture.md)
Loosely coupled architectures are of paramount importance in software delivery due to their ability to enable scalability, flexibility, and adaptability in modern development environments. They reduce risks associated with changes, support parallel development efforts, and simplify testing and debugging processes. Loosely coupled systems are more fault-tolerant and resilient, ensuring continued operation in the face of component failures. They also align with cloud-native and microservices approaches, facilitating the rapid delivery of modern applications. Furthermore, their maintainability and technology-agnostic nature make them ideal for long-term sustainability.


## [Infrastructure Management](infrastructure-management.md)
Many organisations seek flexible technical infrastructure, often in the form of cloud computing. However, many organisations still use their traditional datacenter practices and processes to manage their cloud infrastructure, they canâ€™t achieve the expected benefits, which include: Improved software delivery performance, Better service availability and better cost optimisation. One of the best ways of improving is by implementing Infrastructure as Code.
