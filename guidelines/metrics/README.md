# Metrics

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics play a pivotal role in software development by offering quantifiable measurements of DevOps performance. These metrics serve as benchmarks, providing visibility into the entire development pipeline, enabling continuous improvement, and guiding resource allocation. They also align software development practices with strategic goals, mitigate risks by identifying issues early, and enhance customer satisfaction through efficient and reliable delivery.


## [Change Fail Percentage](change-fail-percentage.md)
By minimizing the likelihood of changes causing disruptions or issues, organisations can maintain consistent operations and prevent costly downtime. This fosters a culture of quality and efficiency, encouraging teams to make changes with confidence and agility.


## [Deployment Frequency](deployment-frequency.md)
A higher deployment frequency signifies greater agility and responsiveness to customer needs. Organisations that deploy frequently can deliver value more rapidly, respond quickly to market changes, and stay competitive. Moreover, frequent deployments encourage smaller, more manageable changes, reducing the risk of disruptions and enabling faster issue resolution.


## [Lead Time](lead-time.md)
By reducing lead times, organisations can expedite their processes, respond more quickly to customer demands, and bring products or services to market faster. This enhanced speed enables organisations to stay competitive, adapt to changing circumstances, and seize opportunities swiftly.


## [Mean Time to Restore](mean-time-to-restore.md)
By swiftly restoring normal operations, organisations can maintain productivity and customer satisfaction while avoiding costly delays. This process also promotes efficiency, as it encourages proactive measures to prevent future incidents and enhance resilience.


## [Reliability](reliability.md)
By ensuring consistent performance and predictability, reliability minimizes disruptions and downtime, allowing processes to run smoothly and consistently. This reduces the need for troubleshooting and rework, enabling teams to focus on productive tasks and goals.
