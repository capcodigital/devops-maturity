# Release Management


## [Release Techniques](release-techniques.md)
Release techniques allow your teams to experiment with new changes as well as release changes with a higher degree of confidence. Using the correct type of release technique can allow a team a closer feedback loop with the business thus improving the quality of the delivery.


## [Ease To Release](ease-to-release.md)
Having a well-documented release and change management process in place with clear guidelines of what is required to receive approvals aids your team in delivering new features and components in an organised way. Resulting in more reliable timelines and less chance of change failures.


## [Proactive Production Management](proactive-production-management.md)
Managing production workloads in an automated way with continuity in mind ensures there will be a faster recovery and less business impact in the case of an outage. It allows developers to spend more time for creating value rather than spend their time solving/troubleshooting production issues.
