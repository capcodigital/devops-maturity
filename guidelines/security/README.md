# Security


## [Design Principles](design-principals.md)
Implementing the right security design principles provides a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating security risks. These principles reduce the likelihood of security breaches, safeguarding sensitive data, and preventing costly post-production fixes. Moreover, adherence to security design principles ensures compliance with regulatory requirements, fostering trust with users and minimising reputational risks. It also enables efficient incident response and supports scalability and adaptability as software evolves.


## [Implementation](implementation.md)
Implementing the right security strategy in software delivery accelerates flow by addressing security considerations early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of costly delays and disruptions. This strategy incorporates automated security testing, shift-left security practices, and DevSecOps collaboration to ensure that security is integrated seamlessly. By identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities proactively, organisations minimise the need for rework and emergency fixes.


## [Security Testing & Reporting](security-testing-and-reporting.md)
Security testing and reporting are essential aspects of software delivery due to their critical roles in safeguarding sensitive data, preventing cyberattacks, ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining trust. These practices identify vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches, costly downtime, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. Timely reporting allows for proactive mitigation, cost savings, and business continuity
