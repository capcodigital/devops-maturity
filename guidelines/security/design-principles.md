# [Security](README.md) - Design Principles


Security design best practices are fundamental principles and guidelines that help organisations and developers create systems, applications, and networks that are resilient against security threats and vulnerabilities. Adhering to these practices is crucial for safeguarding data, protecting against cyberattacks, and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.


**Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**

PoLP is a fundamental concept in computer security and access control. It dictates that any user, system, or process should be granted the minimum level of access and permissions needed to perform its required functions and tasks, and no more. In other words, individuals or entities should have only the privileges essential for their role or job, and they should not possess excess permissions.


Examples of implementing the Principle of Least Privilege include:

* A regular employee should not have administrative privileges on their computer.
* Database administrators should have access only to the databases they are responsible for and not to unrelated data.
* Software applications should only have access to the system resources and data necessary for their intended functions.

Adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege is a crucial security practice because it limits the attack surface and minimises the potential for unauthorised access and misuse of resources. It's an integral part of security best practices in system administration, application development, and overall access control strategies.


**Security Awareness Training**

Security awareness training in software development refers to the education and instruction provided to developers, programmers, and other personnel involved in software development to raise their awareness of security best practices, vulnerabilities, and potential threats. The primary goal of this training is to instill a security-conscious mindset in software development teams and empower them to develop more secure code and applications. Here are some key aspects of security awareness training in software development:

1. **Awareness of Security Threats**: Training provides developers with knowledge about common security threats and vulnerabilities that can affect software applications, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and data breaches.
1. **Secure Coding Practices**: Developers are educated about secure coding practices, which include techniques to prevent security vulnerabilities in code. This training covers areas like input validation, output encoding, and authentication and authorisation best practices.
1. **Security Principles and Standards**: Developers are familiarised with established security principles and industry standards, such as the OWASP Top Ten, CWE/SANS Top 25, and ISO/IEC 27001. They learn how to apply these principles to their work.
1. **Secure Architecture Design**: Training emphasises the importance of secure architecture design. Developers learn to incorporate security considerations into the design phase, selecting security patterns and controls.
1. **Vulnerability Detection and Testing**: Developers are trained to identify and test for security vulnerabilities in their code. They learn to use security scanning tools and perform manual code reviews to find and remediate issues.
1. **Data Privacy and Compliance**: Training covers data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and compliance requirements. Developers learn to handle sensitive data and protect user privacy.
1. **Incident Response**: Developers are educated about incident response procedures and their roles in responding to security incidents and breaches. They learn how to recognise and report security incidents.
1. **Security Tools and Technologies**: Training introduces developers to security tools and technologies that can aid in secure development, such as security libraries, authentication protocols, and encryption methods.
1. **Security Culture**: Beyond technical knowledge, security awareness training promotes a security culture within the development team. Developers are encouraged to take ownership of security and consider it a shared responsibility.
1. **Phishing Awareness**: Training may include guidance on recognising and avoiding phishing attacks and social engineering tactics that can target developers and compromise their credentials.
1. **Secure Development Lifecycle**: Developers learn about Secure Software Development Lifecycles (SSDLC) and how to integrate security into every phase of the development process, from planning to deployment.
1. **Continuous Learning**: Security awareness is an ongoing process. Developers are encouraged to stay updated on evolving threats and security best practices.

Security awareness training is critical in the software development process because it helps identify and address security issues early, reducing the cost and impact of vulnerabilities. It also plays a significant role in reducing security incidents and protecting sensitive data, ultimately enhancing the trust and reputation of software products and services.
