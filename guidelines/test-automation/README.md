# Test Automation


## [Performance Testing](performance-testing.md)
Performance testing is a non-functional software testing technique that determines how the stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of an application holds up under a given workload. It’s a key step in ensuring software quality, but unfortunately, is often seen as an afterthought, in isolation, and to begin once functional testing is completed, and in most cases, after the code is ready to release.


## [Security Testing](security-testing.md)
Detecting security vulnerabilities in an automated way is essential in a rapidly evolving digital world. There are various strategies and testing methods a team can employ to accomplish this. Teams who shift left with their security testing are able to detect and remediate vulnerabilities before it leaves the developer's environment. Common security testing is SAST and DAST which test against sets of known vulnerabilities thus avoiding accidental exposure of sensitive information.


## [Testing Maturity](testing-maturity.md)
Having a mature team with a solid approach and implementation of testing on all levels provides you with the highest level of confidence when developing new features/components. Some of the benefits include less time spent on fixing bugs, faster feedback loops on issues and having lower failure rate when releasing new features to production.


## [Testing Standardisation](testing-standardisation.md)
Testing standardisation provides the organisation a level of confidence that all test automation developed is covering their standards. One of the best approaches is to create frameworks which are a set of rules and corresponding tools that are used for building test cases. It is designed to help engineering functions work more efficiently. Some of the benefits of test automation are reusability, low cost, minimal manual interference and improved efficiency.


## [Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md)
Having a proper test strategy in place ensures that the investment in test automation provides a good balance between time and resource investment versus the confidence level achieved. A common recommendation is following a testing pyramid where at lower levels you write more tests as they are cheaper to write and maintain, and quicker to run. Whereas tests on the upper levels are more expensive to write and maintain, and slower to run. Having a well-defined testing strategy ensures that everyone on the team is putting in the right amount of work in the right places.


## [Usability Testing](usability-testing.md)
Accessibility testing aims to ensure that user interfaces that are being built are following a set of standards so that users with difficulties/impairments don’t have to overcome additional barriers to use the product. To achieve this it is common to adopt a set of standards, best practices whilst developing frontend based applications/components. This will ensure that for example certain fonts and font sizes that users struggle to read will be avoided.
