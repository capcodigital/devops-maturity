# [Test Automation](README.md) - Performance Testing


Performance testing is a non-functional software testing technique that determines how the stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of an application holds up under a given workload. It’s a key step in ensuring software quality, but unfortunately, is often seen as an afterthought, in isolation, and to begin once functional testing is completed, and in most cases, after the code is ready to release.

The goals of performance testing include evaluating application output, processing speed, data transfer velocity, network bandwidth usage, maximum concurrent users, memory utilisation, workload efficiency, and command response times.


**Some tips when implementing performance testing**:

* Identify test tools that best automate your performance testing plan.
* Run tests several times to obtain an accurate measure of the application’s performance. If you are running a load test for instance, run the same test multiple times to determine whether the outcome is consistent before you mark the performance as acceptable or unacceptable.
* Do not make changes to the testing environment between tests.
