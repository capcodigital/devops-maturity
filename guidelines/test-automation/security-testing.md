**API Security**

APIs are a critical part of modern mobile, SaaS and web applications and can be found in customer-facing, partner-facing and internal applications. By nature, APIs expose application logic and sensitive data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and because of this have increasingly become a target for attackers.

**OWASP**

The OWASP® Foundation works to improve the security of software through its community-led OSS projects. Here API Security focuses on strategies and solutions to understand and mitigate the unique vulnerabilities and security risks of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

**DAST**

Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is the process of testing an application or software product in an operating state. This kind of testing is helpful for industry-standard compliance and general security protections for evolving projects.

* DAST is an application security solution that can help to find certain vulnerabilities in web applications while they are running in production.
* DAST test is also known as black-box testing because it is performed without a view into the internal source code or application architecture – it essentially uses the same techniques that an attacker would use to find potential weaknesses.
* DAST test can look for a broad range of vulnerabilities, including input/output validation issues that could leave an application vulnerable to cross-site scripting or SQL injection.

**SAST**

Static application security testing (SAST) is a type of security testing that relies on inspecting the source code of an application. In general, SAST involves looking at the ways the code is designed to pinpoint possible security flaws.

With SAST, testers read the source code, they look for logical flaws, such as a loophole in data control, something that a hacker could use to gain access to the system. SAST is also known as white-box testing because the source code for the application is available and transparent.

By detecting security flaws during the first stages of development – as opposed to other forms of testing right before release or in post-production – high-risk issues can be resolved quickly and without needing to break the application build. When security testing isn’t run throughout the SDLC, there’s a higher risk of allowing vulnerabilities to get through to the released application, increasing the chance of allowing hackers through the application.

By embedding Static Application Security Testing throughout an organisation's SDLC, all team members working on the code can receive near real-time feedback on the code they’re working on.
