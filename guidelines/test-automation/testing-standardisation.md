**Test automation frameworks**

Test automation frameworks are a set of rules and corresponding tools that are used for building test cases. It is designed to help engineering functions work more efficiently.

The general rules for automation frameworks include coding standards that you can avoid manually entering, test data handling techniques and benefits, accessible storage for the derived test data results, object repositories, and additional information that might be utilized to run the tests suitably.

**Advantages of Test Automation Frameworks**

* **Code Reusability**: Since these frameworks come with the required coding data beneficial for the automation test to become a success, the valuable data is saved for future use and can be reused at any given point in time. There is no need to insert codes manually or rearrange them. The code can also be utilized to run other automation framework tests. The developed scripts can also be retained.
* **Low Cost**: Test cases can be developed fairly cheaply because the frameworks already have established rules. Also, given these codes can be reused multiple times, the cost and time of building test cases for new features are low.
* **Minimal Manual Interference**: The automation frameworks run according to the guidelines surrounding them. Since maximum coverage is already built and achieved at the initial stage, there is very little or no intervention required by individuals to run the automation tests. If the process fails, the automation frameworks can be rerun with some change, but the data remains constant and lacks additional effort from an individual or team.
* **Improved Efficiency**: Test automation frameworks increase productivity due to standardization. It guarantees maximum test coverage as the set of codes in a framework is executed in a standard manner from the beginning.
